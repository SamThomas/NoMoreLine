NoMoreLine
==========

This project consists in providing to any type of airports a queue management and crowd detection system. 

The No More Line system merges a statistics approach and a real-time crowd-detection solution to overcome the overcrowded queue areas and make the waiting in airports as short as possible.

The statistics comes from the attendance numbers collected by airport employees over the past few years. 
Equally important, the crowd-detection application provides a real-time solution to monitor the traveller inflows 
inside the airport.
